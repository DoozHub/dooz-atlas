# MCP Entry: dwf-v2 (Modern Laravel 11 ERP)

**Repo:** `/Users/akshaydoozie/Documents/doozie/dwf-v2`  
**Iteration:** 001  
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-14T18:55:00Z  
**Analyst:** SequentialThinking MCP

---

## Observations

1. Laravel 11 application with Vite, Tailwind CSS
2. Has dedicated `docs/` folder (good sign)
3. Generic Laravel README - not customized for dwf-v2
4. Modern stack: Laravel 11, Vite, Tailwind, Node.js
5. Has .env and .env.example properly
6. API-focused with routes/ directory
7. Includes `postcss.config.js` and `tailwind.config.js`

---

## Inferences

1. Modernization effort of dwf (upgrading from legacy)
2. Incomplete documentation - docs folder exists but README is generic
3. Frontend modernization - moving to Vite/Tailwind from legacy
4. Active development - recent modifications

---

## Risks

- **MEDIUM**: Documentation mismatch - generic README doesn't describe dwf-v2
- **LOW**: Stack is modern and maintainable
- **LOW**: Proper environment configuration

---

## Recommendations

1. Replace generic README with product-specific documentation
2. Document upgrade path from dwf (legacy) to dwf-v2
3. Create ARCHITECTURE.md explaining Laravel 11 structure
4. Document the frontend stack choices

---

**Next Analysis:** Review docs/ folder contents and Laravel 11 structure
